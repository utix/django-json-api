**django-json-api** uses Django's ORM interfaces as inspiration to serialize, request and
deserialize entities from databases of other microservices using (and benefiting from) the
[JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/) specification.


## Installation

To install via pip:

```sh
pip install django-json-api
```

You can also install from the source:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:share-work/django-json-api.git
cd django-json-api
git checkout main
pip install -e .
```

## Getting started

Suppose you have a `django.db.models.Model` class inside microservice A, such as:

```python
from django.db import models

class Company(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=256)
    domain = models.CharField(max_length=256)
    deleted_at = models.DateTimeField(null=True, default=None)
```

If you wish to consume it from microservice B, first add this insidde the aforementioned model's
definition:


```python
    class JSONAPIMeta:
        resource_name = 'companies'
```

and define an instance of a `django_json_api.models.JSONAPIModel` inside microservice B:

```python
from django_json_api.models import JSONAPIModel
from django_json_api.fields import Attribute

class Company(JSONAPIModel):
    class Meta:
        api_url = MICROSERVICE_A_API_URL
        resource_type = 'companies'

    name = Attribute()
    domain = Attribute()
```

PS: `api_url` expects a url with protocol (i.e. starting with `http(s)://`) and ending with a trailing slash `/`.

Now, querying companies from microservice B is as easy as:

```python
  Company.objects.all()
  Company.objects.filter(name="Sharework")
  Company.objects.iterator()
  ...
```

You can also have entities in one microservice relate to entities in another by leveraging both `RelatedJSONAPIField`
and `WithJSONAPIQuerySet`. Take a look at this model definition from microservice B:

```python
from django.db import models
from django_json_api.django import RelatedJSONAPIField


class User(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=256)
    company = RelatedJSONAPIField(json_api_model=Company)
    deleted_at = models.DateTimeField(null=True, default=None)
```

Here, `Company` is the `JSONAPIModel` defined above. This makes it possible, when querying for a user, to also
fetch its related company:

```python
user = User.objects.get(pk=1)
user.company # This will be resolved through an underlying HTTP request
```

In case of larger querysets, you might want to prefetch the relations as you do with django's `prefetch_related`. For
that, you imbue `User`'s manager using `WithJSONApiQuerySet`, which will grant the manager a new
method: `prefetch_jsonapi`.
